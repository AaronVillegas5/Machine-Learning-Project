Project Overview

This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign. Multiple machine learning models were implemented and compared, including:

Random Forest Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The project includes feature importance analysis, correlation heatmaps, and visual comparisons of model accuracies to explore which features are most predictive.

Notes / Future Work

Explore reducing feature redundancy to simplify models.

Test other classifiers or ensemble methods for improved performance.

Deploy the model for educational or clinical insights in breast cancer diagnosis.
